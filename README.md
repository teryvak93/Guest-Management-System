This was the final project of Business Process Modelling. 

The chosen problem was to model a guest management system for a restaurant and create sample databases and reporting queries.

Background:  A restaurant chain has several fine dining restaurants in many locations across the globe. Each restaurant is based in a large outdoor location and has a changing menu, based on a weekly theme (example:Halloween), which makes it unique. It is also known for its exceptional food, impeccable style and the outdoor ambience that varies by theme. These features of the restaurant have made it really popular among customers.

Currently, the restaurant chain has no database management system in place and it operates on restaurant pagers for table reservation. Obtaining a table reservation is the biggest problem that the restaurant patron faces due to high demand and long wait times to serve and clear tables. 

This has resulted in the loss of a significant customer base overall, which in turn led to decrease in overall revenue and market share in the restaurant industry space.

The restaurant chain also wants to see improvement in their billing process which will in turn decrease the average time during the payment of bill. The proposal is to add a guest management system to make their process efficient using technology and data reporting

Process Objectives:
●	To minimize the wait time as much as possible and allocate tables more efficiently.

Triggering Event :
●	· Customer decided to dine at our fine dining restaurant
